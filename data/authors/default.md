Hey everyone, Nick here. Just wanted to share a little about myself. I am a 28 year old dude living in San Diego.

I have always had people ask me about projects I am working on, what I am doing, and I've always just gave short brief answers when they wanted more. So I decided to start this blog in hopes to inspire others, and show others what I know. I thought it would be a great way for me to share what I am doing with others, as well as make a record of everything I do in life.

So Cheers! You can find my contact information below and reach out if you have questions!
