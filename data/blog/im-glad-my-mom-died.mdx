**Rating: 7/10**

I was browsing for my next book to read after Project Hail Mary, and stumbled upon "I'm Glad My Mom Died" by Jennette McCurdy. I saw some posts on Reddit talking about it so I gave it a shot, and I still have mixed feelings about it. I was expecting this just to
be another memoir about a Hollywood star if you will, but it was a bit deeper than I expected. If you continue reading be prepared for spoilers.

The book is divided into 2 sections, before Mom and after Mom dies. I clearly remember watching iCarly as a kid and remember Jennette McCurdy aka Sam as a character apart of my childhood. I laughed and enjoyed this show as I was growing up, but little was known about what was happening behind the scenes of Jennette. The book has completely changed my perspective towards iCarly. It has changed my perspective with how Hollywood treats kids and teenagers. The abuse that happened not only came from her family, but the creator of the show, and the treatment from the Nickelodean studio.

The book dives into her family relationship as a child, which after hearing about it you realize there is bound to be some messed up side effects that dwindle into the kids. The mother is controlling, abuse, and manipulative to say the least. The father is just there. The brothers have no guidance and are also after thoughts to the parents. Jennette starts her acting career at the age of 6, due to the mother's will. The mother believed her life was robbed from her so she can project her life into her child's. It's challenging to read through the struggles Jennette faces, from caloric deficit diets the mom instills in her at a young age, to the helicopter parenting into her late teens with showers and grooming done. She was so underdeveloped even after becoming an adult it was hard to digest. While reading, I couldn't comprehend how things at even ages 16-21 were still happening. She was brainwashed, and did not know any better.

There are some highlights in the book that help deter the negatives away, such as Miranda Cosgrove & Colton being good friends. Specifically Cosgrove. She was the only thing that I believe kept Jennette sane through her life and I have a new found respect for her.

Jennette's writing is straight forward and to the point. There is no lingering or extra details needed, she says just what she wants. The book chapters are more like individual anecdotes of her life at certain periods and they are short and sweet, well not sweet in terms of what her life consisted of. Child Stardom is an issue we see from time to time again, and most do not adjust past being that, a child star. While the book made me uneasy and angry at times, I believe it was worth the read to enlighten myself on child actors and Hollywood.
