**Rating: 7/10**

I was browsing for my next book to read after Project Hail Mary, and stumbled upon "I'm Glad My Mom Died" by Jennette McCurdy. I saw some posts on Reddit talking about it so I gave it a shot, and I still have mixed feelings about it. I was expecting this just to be another memoir about a Hollywood star if you will, but it was a bit deeper than I expected. If you continue reading be prepared for spoilers.

The book is divided into 2 sections, before Mom and after Mom dies. I clearly remember watching iCarly as a kid and remember Jennette McCurdy aka Sam as a character apart of my childhood. I laughed and enjoyed this show as I was growing up, but little was known about what was happening behind the scenes of Jennette. The book has completely changed my perspective towards iCarly. It has changed my perspective with how Hollywood treats kids and teenagers. The abuse that happened not only came from her family, but the creator of the show, and the treatment from the Nickelodean studio.

The book dives right into Jennette's early age acting career and family relationships. The mother believed her life was robbed from her so she can project her life into her child's. She is controlling, abusive, and manipulative to say the least. The father is just there. The brothers have no guidance and are also after thoughts to the parents. It's a challenge to read through the struggles Jennette faces, from caloric deficit diets the mom instills in her at a young age, to the helicopter parenting into her late teens with showers and grooming done. She was so underdeveloped even after becoming an adult it was hard to digest. While reading, I couldn't comprehend how things at even ages 16-21 were still happening.

There are some highlights in the book that help deter the negatives away, such as Miranda Cosgrove being a great friend. She was the only thing that I believe kept Jennette sane through her life and I have a new found respect for her.

Jennette's writing is straight forward and to the point. There is no lingering or extra details needed, she says just what she wants. The book chapters are chronological anecdotes of her life at certain periods as she ages making it easy to follow along and take in. I do believe there should be a warning in the front that the book could trigger a response from readers that suffer from the problems she suffers, but _shrugs_.

Child Stardom is an issue we see from time to time again, and most do not adjust past being that, a child star. While the book made me uneasy and angry at times, I believe it was worth the read to enlighten myself on Hollywood and adolescent actors.
