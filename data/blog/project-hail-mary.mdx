Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. The gem of a book. This is one of my favorite books of 2022 so far. I finished this book in 24 hours, I could not put it down. Andy Weir is also the author of Artemis, and The Martian, which you may know from the movie with Matt Damon. I don't really know where to start with this book, but I am going to try and make this light and fun.

Andy Weir takes you along this journey that makes you feel like you are watching your favorite TV Show in your head. You can feel, see, smell, taste the scenes as the book goes on. The book is based on a scientist Dr.Rhyland Grace who must face adversity and scientific challenges he has never expected, on top of saving humanity from a apocolyptic space event.

The author does a good job at keeping the scientific jargon to an average reader. Basic knowledge of gravity, temperatures, densities, weight, etc help readers stay engaged without being too much of a scientific textbook. There are moments when I question if any of the science actually makes sense, but its sci-fi, and it doesn't have to. I mean he meets an alien and we all know aliens don't _exist_.

What I did not like about this book, is that Andy Weir seems to put in place problems that can easily be avoided just for the sake of there being a problem for the book to have. Randomly spinning out of control and not wearing a seat belt, the computer not helping him understand basic parts of the ship, there is a robot on the ship, but he is required to do a lot of the maintenance. There are some more random plot holes, but if you can look over that, the end result is a captivating space experience.

There is so much to love about this book. From the quirky dialogue and engagements, to the easy to digest science, and the mystery of literally everything happening.

The book starts with Dr. Rhyland Grace a middle school science teacher, in space, waking from a coma and he has no idea why he is there. You eventually find out that he is placed there to figure out how to stop an invasive microbe, Astrophage, from eating the sun. Due to the memory loss from amnesia, you are constantly piecing things together with Dr. Grace to figure out why he's there, and what he is suppose to be doing. You have no idea where he is, why he is there, everything is a mystery. It stays that way till about 3/4 of the way in, and you finally connect all the pieces together.

Rocky and Dr. Grace have this delightful and charming connection that develops throughout the entire book. Weir does a good job at keeping it engaging, and fun. I was so invested in Rocky, and their people. Andy Weir describes the reason we may have encountered another species that is nearly identical, is due to the fact we may be at the same stage in evolution. We are both species that rose to the top of food chains, and are fighting the same problem at the same time. Other species that are more advanced may have already solved this issue in their solar system, and we are now just getting to it. All the Sci-Fi elements that are not real are explained so logically and well it just flows with the book. The plot never seems to have such a big plot hole that it sounds absurd.
