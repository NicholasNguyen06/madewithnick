summary: In 2020 I decided to build a home gym. I was tired of commuting to a gym, waiting for machines, and then commuting back. It was time to bring the gym to my garage and reap the benefits!

I have been using public gyms for a little over 10 years now. From high school gyms to college. Then eventually to the dreaded 24 Hour Fitness and Crunch Fitness. I've had a decent experience, and have been able to get solid workouts in everywhere I go, but there were a few things that frustrated me.

- **Commute time**: 30 minutes &#8594; **0 minutes**
  - My commute to my first job post college was about 20 minutes, then the commute from there to by gym was another 15 minutes, then my drive home was about 30 minutes with traffic. So I was driving for a little over an hour everyday, with a percentage of that being the gym.
- **Equipment wait times:** 20-30 minutes &#8594; **0 minutes**
  - Some of you may be in smaller cities, but in San Diego gyms can be quite crowded. Sometimes you can wait upwards of 15+ minutes for a squat rack to open. Dumbbells would all be non existent because some people would take multiple sets. On certain days it just throws off your entire routine.
- **Germs**: 3-4 colds a year&#8594; **1-2 colds a year**
  - I was getting sick way more often than not going to public gyms.

After designing my home gym and finally getting to a sweet spot, I can say from experience it has changed my way of working out. I went mainly with Rogue equipment as its one of the premiere companies, but other brands like Rep Fitness came close to my choice. They have some gear that
I believe I would enjoy more, but I will post secondary recommendations of things I wish I would've bought alongside the equipment I purchased.

Below I am going to outline everything I use, along with the Pro's and Con's of each. I think I have gotten to a sweet spot in equipment and then a few things I would like to add down the line. There are definitely more budget friendly pieces you could choose, but I wanted quality, and something that will last a lifetime.

**Total Cost**: ~$8,000

## Flooring

[Horse Stall Mats](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/4-ft-x-6-ft-x-3-4-in-thick-rubber-stall-mat)

These are pretty much in every home gym you see. They are perfect for a gym floor as they protect the subfloor, they reduce noise, and are overall indestructible. I placed these on top of the two subfloors below, using a sawzall to cut pieces that weren't 4x6 fitting.

[3/4" OSB Flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/p/OSB-7-16-in-Sheathing-Panel-Application-as-4-ft-x-8-ft-386081/202106230)

This is a much cheaper option that using a Birch Plywood sheet listed below. You can snag these for abotu $20 and they lock in place making it easier for the subfloor to remain intact and the mats on top to mount into.

[3/4" Plywood](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Columbia-Forest-Products-3-4-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-PureBond-Birch-Plywood-165921/1000778370)

I started with Birch Plywood sheets as my subfloor, but this was not cost effective. I use these under my deadlift area only, and the rest is OSB, which is linked above and is as effective, and more frugal.

## Equipment

### Squat Rack - [Rogue RML-490 Power Rack](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-rml-490-power-rack)

This squat rack is an absolute tank. It can withstand anything you throw at it, with the added benefit of being accessory friendly. I mount plates, dip bars, pull-up bar and safety arms to this, but there is so much more you can add to it. Would I purchase this again in the future if I had to, probably not. It's actually quite overkill for my needs, and a very large piece of machinery to have in a home gym. I would have much rather gone with the [RML-3WC Wall Mounted Rack](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-rml-3wc-fold-back-wall-mount-rack-custom-color-edition) to save space, and to have a less cluttered gym.

- #### Accessories:
  - [Plate Storage Pair](https://www.roguefitness.com/sp3358-plate-storage-long-for-monster-lite)
    I used these at first and I thought they were great. There was one thing that made me transition to a floor solution. If you mount these on the sides of the rack, if there is plates on them, then you will hit them while squatting or benching in the rack. So you would have to remove all the weight before lifting. Small issue, but enough of an annoyance that I switched to [Horizontal Plate Rack](https://repfitness.com/collections/plate-storage/products/horizontal-plate-rack).
  - [Monster Lite Matador](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-monster-lite-matador)
    This little accessory is a great space saver and a decent piece of equipment to add to the home gym with minimal footprint. I have heard it has a bit of a wide grip and is not suitable for everyone, but it works great for myself. My one complaint is the shakyness of it as you dip, but it is easy to look past for the price point and foot print.
  - [Landmine](https://www.roguefitness.com/landmines)
    Another solid accessory that is exactly what you get. A small footprint piece of hardware that extends the capability of your gym with a few more exercises. Worth every penny.

### Bench - [Rogue Adjustable Bench](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-adjustable-bench-3-0)

This was a splurge purchase. I was able to convince myself that I was already spending the money for a home gym, what was couple hundred more dollars. So I purchased this. The build quality is insane, it is heavy as sh\*t, and is stable as can be. This is the nicest bench I have ever used even at a commercial gym. It does not get better than this. There are definitely more frugal option though, so shop around if necessary

### Bumper Plates - [Mil Spec Echo](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-mil-echo-bumper-plates-black)

I have sets of 45's, 35's, 25's, & 10's. These things are awesome. Low profile, sleek and durable. I deadlift, squat, overhead press, and do all my lifts with these. I slam them, and they bounce great. The price : pound ratio is on the heavier side, but also on the cheaper side to most bumper plates. I would repurchase these in a heart beat, but I am a sucker for the colored bumper plates, so I will be moving forward with different plates as I need more weight.

### Cable Machine - [Inspire FTX](https://www.costco.com/inspire-fitness-ftx-functional-trainer-with-bench-%2526-1-year-inspire-fitness-app-subscription-included.product.100486673.html)

I was able to buy this used on FB marketplace for &#0036;700, which was an absolute steal, and I still see some pop up from time to time for &#0036;900-1,000. The utility to price point on this machine is crazy. The cable machine opens up the possibilities in the home gym by more than any machines I have purchased yet.

### Cardio - [Concept 2 Rower](https://www.roguefitness.com/black-concept-2-rowerg-rower-pm5-black)

This was my final purchase. I was bouncing back and forth between an assault bike and this, and ended up with the rower.

### Dumbells

I purchased a mix weight stack + rack off of OfferUp 5-757's for about &#0036;700. Dumbells can be quite expensive, and generally it is recommended to use adjustable dumbbells for space and cost.

### Leg Machine - [Titan Leg Extension/Curl](https://www.titan.fitness/strength/specialty-machines/lower-body/leg-extension-and-curl-machine-v2/401556.html)

There was one thing missing from the gym and it was another way to hit legs. Outside of dumbell, squat and deadlift variations I was finding it hard to get variation into my leg workouts. This machine adds two more exercises that are nice to have, but not a requirement. I will say it does have some caveats to it, such as being plate loaded vs weight stack loaded. It does not hit the same... unfortunately. Would I purchase this again? Yeah probably, because it is the most frugal, space saving and effective option out there, but I do wish I had a cable loaded machine.

## Extras

### [Dip Belt](https://www.roguefitness.com/dip-belt)

Great way to improve tricep strength, as well as pull-up strength.

### [Hip Circle](https://www.roguefitness.com/sling-shot-hip-circle)

A way to add hip abduction to my workouts. I have a weak left knee and can fix my imbalances with this.

### [Jump Rope]()

Easy way to warmup and get some cardio in.

### [Dead Wedge](https://www.roguefitness.com/the-dead-wedge)

Save my back when loading plates onto the bar.
